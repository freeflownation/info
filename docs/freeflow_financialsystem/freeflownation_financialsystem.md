## FreeFlow Currencies

![hands full of coffee beans](coffee.png)

Our FFC’s (FreeFlow Currencies)  represent the birth of new kinds of digital currencies;  ones that are designed to be responsible, value-backed and serve a real market and human requirement. They are not speculative instruments or interest driven by design, rather their value and growth are dependent on the social or market problem they aim to resolve and by design all FFC’ s are driven by the same narrative; value, fairness and inclusion. Eventually there will be hundreds of different types of currencies but the first currencies we start with are listed below:

### ThreeFold Token (Now)

A reliable & responsible digital currency. This is the token used to build the ThreeFold grid.

Corresponds with internet capacity = has a real value.

* Internet capacity = fuel for the digital economy and is growing super fast

* No tokens have ever been printed, it's not hyped; every token is result of farming & capacity generated in the field.

Undervalued at this point

* Today more capacity compared to all other blockchain companies combined

* Other blockchain company's market cap = multiple billions.

* Our market cap of liquid tokens < 20m USD. Other blockchain company's market cap = multiple billions.

### EuroFlow Token (Q3)

Wouldn’t it be nice you can do digital business with a token which has a 1-1 relationship with the EUR.

1 EUR Token has same value as 1 EUR and is guaranteed available. Regular audits guarantee the availability of all tokens.

### GoldFlow Token (Q2)

1 Gold Token corresponds with 1 gram of physically stored Gold (in Denmark). The vault has capacity for 1.000 ton of gold. Each token has the exact same value of 1 gram of gold and can be freely used to do business or as a store of value.

### FreeFlow Token (Q3)

Freeflow Token corresponds to 1 h of labour. Each user into the FreeFlow notion gets 100 h worth of free FreeFlow Tokens. This token can be used to exchange value. It's a token especially important for refugee camps or other places where money is not available yet still people want to exchange services.

### FairCoffee Token (2020)

A Coffee Token corresponds with 1 kg of coffee. FCT will enable transparent end to end journey from production to market to ensure source, transparency and fairness to local farmers.

### Veda Education Token and Organic Farming Token (Q4)

The Veda Education Token can be used to help children with access to education.

The Organic Farming Token is a token which is the only means of buying certain products from certain farming areas (in first version Costa Rica). 

This token has the same value as 1 TFT.
