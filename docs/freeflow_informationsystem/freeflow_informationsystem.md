# FreeFlow Information System

The world needs an efficient** ****[Decentralized Information Syste**m](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1uZT03h4QLBh2RYEnUjZQvi2Xoy8fjbUn1eZN_PM8g6g)**.** ThreeFold has created technology which can be used to develop such a system running on top of the ThreeFold grid as described in previous chapter. 

## From Pyramids To FreeFlow Circles

[Pyramids to FreeFlow](pyramides.png)

Today every service on the internet is fully centralized. As discussed earlier we have become a product and the services we buy are overpriced.

The ThreeFold Grid system allows a different mechanism to use those kinds of services.

We call this mechanism **FreeFlow Circles**.

Our personal 3bot acts as our digital cell which owns all our information and can act on our behalf.

Our personal digital cell is at the center of our FreeFlow Circles.

All of the commonly used applications listed in the pyramid on the left of this graphic are neither in line with the FreeFlow Nation values nor are they good for our World. Our personal 3bot has the capability to eventually become a credible alternative to all these functions.

An ecosystem is growing, please read more about it in the [following document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1TiuVr9xhoAiAqZD0GTMvxphS8oY2CkjM3V2iWIS-p1M/edit?usp=sharing).

**Some examples of services which can run in a personal 3bot.**

* You own your identity and can share in a controlled way

* You publish your own information (like facebook, Wikipedia, …)

* You are your own bank (wallet, exchange, different fiat & digital currencies, gold)

* You have access to your own private browser which runs next to your cell and allows you to browse the internet in all privacy without censorship.

* You have access to a decentralized video/audio conferencing system which cannot be blocked and is much more efficient (faster, fewer resources used).

* You can offer your services to anyone in the world and have equal chances to do so.

* You can buy services from anyone and localized to your situation (taxi, hotels, restaurants, …)

* You can plan your time in relation to your circles (scheduling)

* You have access to any information (education) and can self improve without prejudice

## Marketing upside down

In the FreeFlow Information system, a user gets rewarded for looking around and investigating which products or services to buy.

In our system, you pay for the digital resources you use e.g. storage, network and compute capacity.

The person or company who wants to sell a service can broadcast their offering through opt-in marketing channels.

The FreeFlow Citizen chooses which channels are interesting to his/her current needs and receives money for actually looking at the offerings. E.g. I am looking to rent an apartment in a certain location or I am looking for a web designer or … I will allow publishers to send information to me.

Result

* Merchant will pay much less for marketing his products

* The consumer will receive money for shopping which could be more than the cost of running a 3bot.

Basically, this system puts the marketing world upside down and has benefits for consumers and merchants but not for the intermediaries which often don’t have a lot of added value yet still reap most of the benefits.

## The most scalable system in the world

## Safety & Security

Your information is stored in such a way that it can never be lost or stolen. You have privacy when you need it. You can ask for verification of your information like with a notary.

## Some advantages for the users of this system

* More Performance

    * Decentralized Video/Voice conferencing is faster.

    * Access to information is much faster because information is closer to you.

* More Convenience

    * Because all the apps are built using the same backend system which is basically you, the convenience will be much higher. 

    * No need for credit cards. 

    * Easier combination of services.

* Lower Cost of Services and Products

    * The more efficient system and elimination of certain unneeded middleman will lead to much lower cost of services or products.

    * We believe for certain services the difference can be substantial like up to 50%

* More transparency and information about the source of the service/product

    * Thanks to the 3bot technology it is possible to track the origin of the service you use.

* Build in fair & neutral reputation system improves quality

    * The built in reputation system makes sure that quality and price are aligned.

    * The 3bot verification mechanisms are fair and neutral

* Access to more (educational) information	

    * All information at your fingertips

* Less manipulation	

    * The information you get will come guaranteed from sources you trust. Manipulation should be impossible.

* Equal Rights

    * No matter where you live you will be able to communicate & access information.

* Anyone can deliver services or products online and participate in the FreeFlow Economy.

    * No need for complex e-commerce or payment systems.

More information about how it has been build in our [Decentralized Information System document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1uZT03h4QLBh2RYEnUjZQvi2Xoy8fjbUn1eZN_PM8g6g).

## Viral system

This system is very viral and this will help fast adoption globally. 

Our aim is to have millions of people enabled within a couple of years.

Because of the decentralized nature and no scalability limits this system can scale much faster compared to centralized systems we know today.

## It feels too much, can this really be done?

We believe this is very achievable and in fact we are already well on the way to executing on this mission. Today we already have more capacity online compared to the sum of all other blockchain projects.

We are pragmatic and our motto is to do more with less effort. Our technology allows us to be very efficient and our effort to create these services is maybe upto 100 times easier than if we would have to build these services from scratch.

We need more funding though, we are self funded today and have enough to continue but we feel we can go faster and enable more companies to become part of our FreeFlow Nation.

One of our keys to succeed are our partnerships and already today we have quite some partners aligned to make all of this reality.
