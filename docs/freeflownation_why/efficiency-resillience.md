## Efficiency vs Resilience

[Deserted landscape](desertedlandscape.png)


Professor and currency expert Bernard Lietaer ([http://www.lietaer.com/](http://www.lietaer.com/)) advocated an upgrade of our money systems as a systemic solution to our global economic, financial, and sustainability crisis.

Bernard is a big source of inspiration for the money side of our FreeFlow Nation. 

One of the ideas he advocated is how every system in the world balances between efficiency and resilience. In nature, resilience is several times more important than efficiency.

Understanding parts of his work helps to explain how the world became what it is today. It's the result of a period where efficiency was everything. It gave us the fastest evolution ever achieved in only 100 years but it's not sustainable. His findings can be applied to anything: nature, money, technology, society, ...

A super efficient system like a monoculture such as pine wood will be not very resilient. These types of forests are very susceptible to sickness and fire, while on the other hand, a mixed forest of trees is much more resilient but not so efficient.

Our money system is a monoculture, it's very efficient (money being created out of nothing) but also very vulnerable. There were more than 600 monetary crashes since 1970.

Any system that wants to survive for a long time will have to be in the "window of viability". A well designed digital currency should be there. Or the new information system we have created as well.

Most cryptocurrencies today are also monocultures and therefore unstable by design.

Current internet systems are efficient (controlled) centralized systems, they can be hacked easily (are hacked) and are not private. They are positioned left on this curve.

Blockchain technology is often positioned as the swiss army knife which can save us all and deliver full decentralization. While we believe blockchain technology has lots of potential and is a very important invention for certain workloads, it's not very efficient to be used as an information technology system. It is very reliable though and sits at the right side of this curve.
