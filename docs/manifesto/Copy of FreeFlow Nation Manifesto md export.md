# FreeFlow Nation Manifesto 			[http://](http://freeflowmanifesto.threefold.me)[freeflowmanifesto.threefold.me](http://freeflowmanifesto.threefold.me)

![lanscape](landscape.png)

We (the citizens of FreeFlow Nation) believe the world needs a new nation, a global complementary digital nation. A Nation to complement not replace our existing nations, a Nation which has no physical boundaries and which welcomes everyone as a digital citizen.

**A digital Nation where everyone chooses to honor the following values :
**

1. Everyone can participate and has equal chances

2. Respect is the basis of our communication and actions

3. Everyone has control over their own information & community circles

4. Information is neutral, verifiable and accessible for everyone

5. We should never be a product

6. We need to respect the world’s resources and we need to pay for what we consume

7. Everyone has access to reliable (complementary) currencies

8. Products need to be sustainable and fairly described

9. We accept that we are not powerless and have a responsibility to act 

We have been working for more than 15 years on a technology that can facilitate this platform and vision.

It's not just a set of ideas, we have already developed most of the required technology and are executing a practical achievable plan.

## Our 3x3 FreeFlow Values

[FreeFlow Values](run.png)

### 1. Everyone can participate and has equal chances

* Independent of location, race or religion. Censorship should not block access to information.

* Cost of the information system needs to be low enough so that everyone can afford to participate. 

* Everyone can deliver services or products to everyone else with minimal intermediate steps. Intermediaries are often necessary but should charge fair costs in relation to their added value. 
It's not acceptable that a poor farmer receives only 5% of the price we pay for the product in the shop. This is neither sustainable for them nor for the planet.

### 2. Respect is the basis of our communication and actions.

* We declare that respect and not fear nor ego will be the basis of our communications and our actions in this digital nation. 

* We don’t have to agree, but respect and tolerance for other opinions is a must. 

### 3. Everyone has control over their own information & community circles

* We have sole ownership of our created information/content e.g. photos, text, videos, … 

* No-one has access to our information unless we have given explicit access rights. 

* We define the circles (groups of people) we want to communicate with and we have absolute freedom to decide what we want to share, and with whom we share it. 

* We can at any point in time retrieve/destroy our information or revoke access rights.

### 4. Information is neutral, verifiable and accessible for everyone

* Data cannot be manipulated and we can ask for verification of the information at any point in time, it's up to the person who shares to withhold that  proof but at least we then know that the source wants to stay anonymous and cannot be validated. 

* It should be technically impossible for a hacker or other organization to change information and represent it in another way than originally intended.

* We have the ability to search & consume information in  freedom and neutrality.
We don’t like that an AI (Artificial Intelligence) machine decide what information gets priority or is blocked. Today we navigate in a restricted information world, much smaller than we believe. Keeping us uninformed and manipulating the information which is being presented to us can influence our consumption and voting actions.

* Censorship is not acceptable and goes against our beliefs; info should be accessible for everyone.

### 5. We should never be a product.

<table>
  <tr>
    <td> ![pigs in barn](pigsinbarn.png) </td>
    <td>We have become a product of a big data machine.

Every action we take on our social media, internet searches, … leads to more information used and paid for by ourselves.

We believe we get these services for free. 

Because of this model we pay maybe 20-50% too much for our required products & services.
</td>
  </tr>
</table>


### 6. We need to respect the World’s resources and we need to pay for what we consume

* If we don’t want to be the product then we need to accept paying for what we consume.

* When it's free it means we are the product. Free does not exist, often it means we pay in other ways at a price in excess of  the cost of the resources we actually use.

* We need to be respectful of finite world resources.

### 7. Everyone has access to reliable complementary currencies 

* Complementary currencies are not meant to replace existing currencies but rather complement. They can have unique properties, they can be designed more as a store of value, or serve as a medium of exchange.

* We need to be able to keep our fiat or digital currencies safe at all times.

* We need to be able to exchange value without having to pay huge transaction or exchange fees.

* Others should not be able to influence or obtain a non-transparent benefits from our transactions.

### 8. Products need to be sustainable and fairly described

* We declare that we want to produce high quality and sustainable products or services.

* We need the description of products and services to be done fairly. A transparent reputation system can help.

### 9. We accept that we are not powerless and need to act ourselves.

* Many of us believe we have no choice and need to live in the current structures without a chance to have an impact. We believe everyone is a master of their own destiny.

* The current systems are huge and very efficient but that also makes them very vulnerable

* If only 10 percent of us would change the buying decisions we make, these large companies would not be able to continue the way  they currently work and change would come. These companies are more vulnerable than we believe.

* We have to be responsible and look at the choices we can make ourselves: what do we eat, consume, travel too, …

* This doesn’t mean we have no right to a financially comfortable life, but it means we have to act and help heal the world.

## FreeFlow Definitions

[dictionairy](book.png)

* FreeFlow Nation			: our digital nation

* FreeFlow Values 			: the values of our Nation

* FreeFlow Citizen			: member of our Nation society

* FreeFlow Internet 			: the information highway which allows our Nation to function

* FreeFlow Information System 	: the tool which allows all of us to communicate / collaborate

* FreeFlow Banking System 		: a system which allows us to exchange value

* FreeFlow Projects 			: concrete projects which live inside our Nation

* FreeFlow Fund 			: we need funds to allow our Projects to grow faster

* FreeFlow Currencies 			: currencies as used in our Nation

# Why?

## A Value Shift is happening.

[Value Shift](shift.png)

* From Fear To Love				=  			 respect for self, others & nature

* From Centralization To Decentralisation  	= 			 in control over own destiny

* From Marketing To Transparency	 	=  			 what you see is what you get

More and more people want this value shift to happen and they want to set an example.

### Fear To Love

In our post Darwin times, we have been raised in a fear-driven way. The "survival of the fittest" theme is everywhere: law (contracts), patents, dominate  your markets, be smarter, stronger, … 

There are other equally strong forces which we did not nurture. Our world has become too efficient a place where the law of the strongest rules. If we want to help heal the planet we need to change our mentality towards others and ourselves. We believe the world is shifting, catering for those who want to live their lives based upon love, compassion and respect.

### Decentralization

People are not powerless, they need to take ownership over their own decisions. But to be able to do this they need access to neutral and reliable information. To be able to do this decentralization is a must. Many of us want this to happen.

### Transparency

Too much information is a non fair representation of the reality. As human beings, we need to take responsibility and make sure that we become transparent in our own daily life. More and more people are waking up and  wanting to set an example. Being able to be brutally honest takes a lot of courage and self love.

## Participatory Economy

[wall till debt do us part quote](debtdouspart.png)

Liberalism has brought the world to where we are today. (Un)fortunately the world is now coming to the end of that era, our planet cannot cope with the consequences of the incredible growth we’ve experienced over the last 100 years. 

New systems are required. Some original thinkers have developed a system they describe as a participatory economy. In our FreeFlow Nation, we can potentially adopt some of these concepts and try to build a system which could support these ideas. As far as we know no practical system  has been developed which makes implementing the values of this participatory economic system possible.

Values, as defined in a participatory economy, are:

* Self-Management 	–   decision making in proportion to the degree one is affected

* Justice 		–   reward for effort or personal sacrifice

* Solidarity	 	–   concern for the well-being of others

* Diversity 		–   the flourishing of a variety of lifestyles and outcomes

* Efficiency 		–   meeting our goals without wasting our limited time and resources

* Sustainability 		–   protecting and nurturing our natural environment

## Efficiency vs Resilience

[Deserted landscape](desertedlandscape.png)


Professor and currency expert Bernard Lietaer ([http://www.lietaer.com/](http://www.lietaer.com/)) advocated an upgrade of our money systems as a systemic solution to our global economic, financial, and sustainability crisis.

Bernard is a big source of inspiration for the money side of our FreeFlow Nation. 

One of the ideas he advocated is how every system in the world balances between efficiency and resilience. In nature, resilience is several times more important than efficiency.

Understanding parts of his work helps to explain how the world became what it is today. It's the result of a period where efficiency was everything. It gave us the fastest evolution ever achieved in only 100 years but it's not sustainable. His findings can be applied to anything: nature, money, technology, society, ...

[window of viability](windowofviability.png)

A super efficient system like a monoculture such as pine wood will be not very resilient. These types of forests are very susceptible to sickness and fire, while on the other hand, a mixed forest of trees is much more resilient but not so efficient. 

[monolithic systems](monolithic.png)

Our money system is a monoculture, it's very efficient (money being created out of nothing) but also very vulnerable. There were more than 600 monetary crashes since 1970.

Any system that wants to survive for a long time will have to be in the "window of viability". A well designed digital currency should be there. Or the new information system we have created as well.

Most cryptocurrencies today are also monocultures and therefore unstable by design.

[we became the product](becameaproduct.png)

Current internet systems are efficient (controlled) centralized systems, they can be hacked easily (are hacked) and are not private. They are positioned left on this curve.

Blockchain technology is often positioned as the swiss army knife which can save us all and deliver full decentralization. While we believe blockchain technology has lots of potential and is a very important invention for certain workloads, it's not very efficient to be used as an information technology system. It is very reliable though and sits at the right side of this curve.

The information management system we need for our FreeFlow nation needs to be different:

It should not be like a typical blockchain project (shared information) and it certainly shouldn't be centralized

We believe looking at nature is the biggest source of inspiration. Nature took millions of years to create organisms which are beautiful, resilient and still efficient. 

[bigger organism](scale.png)

More information about technical requirements for a [Decentralized IT system can be found in this document.](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1uZT03h4QLBh2RYEnUjZQvi2Xoy8fjbUn1eZN_PM8g6g)

# FreeFlow Internet

**"We can't solve problems by using the same kind of thinking we used when we created them"  **

**Einstein**

## We need a complementary Internet.

We need a digital backbone to create our FreeFlow Nation. Today we have the internet connecting us all but unfortunately, it's too expensive, power hungry, centralized and not scalable enough.

[notscalable](centralised1.png)

More than 80% of today’s internet capacity is centralized and controlled by just a handful of companies

[centralised](centralised2.png)

## ThreeFold has made such a complementary internet possible

### Inspired By Nature

[inspired by nature](human.png)

Our [Decentralized Information System](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1uZT03h4QLBh2RYEnUjZQvi2Xoy8fjbUn1eZN_PM8g6g) (DIS) Works like Cells in our Body

### The system is active

[active system](gridloupe.png)

**ThreeFold farmers have already deployed 10x more capacity compared 
to the sum of all other decentralized projects together (blockchain).**

**There are 3 ways today which allow you to buy Internet Capacity:**

[Cloud Market](cloud.png)

ThreeFold can deliver Internet Capacity at a price much lower than alternative centralized solutions and is much faster and more scalable compared to some newer blockchain alternatives.

The cost advantages are substantial.

### Unlimited Scalability

[unlimited scale](3bot.png)

In this system the 3bots which are the intelligent cells scale independently from the 3nodes, this creates an unlimited, scalable system. The 3bots use the resources of the 3nodes to bring any required service to life 

More info about this system in our [Decentralized Information System document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1uZT03h4QLBh2RYEnUjZQvi2Xoy8fjbUn1eZN_PM8g6g).

# FreeFlow Information System

The world needs an efficient** ****[Decentralized Information Syste**m](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1uZT03h4QLBh2RYEnUjZQvi2Xoy8fjbUn1eZN_PM8g6g)**.** ThreeFold has created technology which can be used to develop such a system running on top of the ThreeFold grid as described in previous chapter. 

## From Pyramids To FreeFlow Circles

[Pyramids to FreeFlow](pyramides.png)

Today every service on the internet is fully centralized. As discussed earlier we have become a product and the services we buy are overpriced.

The ThreeFold Grid system allows a different mechanism to use those kinds of services.

We call this mechanism **FreeFlow Circles**.

Our personal 3bot acts as our digital cell which owns all our information and can act on our behalf.

Our personal digital cell is at the center of our FreeFlow Circles.

All of the commonly used applications listed in the pyramid on the left of this graphic are neither in line with the FreeFlow Nation values nor are they good for our World. Our personal 3bot has the capability to eventually become a credible alternative to all these functions.

An ecosystem is growing, please read more about it in the [following document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1TiuVr9xhoAiAqZD0GTMvxphS8oY2CkjM3V2iWIS-p1M/edit?usp=sharing).

**Some examples of services which can run in a personal 3bot.**

* You own your identity and can share in a controlled way

* You publish your own information (like facebook, Wikipedia, …)

* You are your own bank (wallet, exchange, different fiat & digital currencies, gold)

* You have access to your own private browser which runs next to your cell and allows you to browse the internet in all privacy without censorship.

* You have access to a decentralized video/audio conferencing system which cannot be blocked and is much more efficient (faster, fewer resources used).

* You can offer your services to anyone in the world and have equal chances to do so.

* You can buy services from anyone and localized to your situation (taxi, hotels, restaurants, …)

* You can plan your time in relation to your circles (scheduling)

* You have access to any information (education) and can self improve without prejudice

## Marketing upside down

In the FreeFlow Information system, a user gets rewarded for looking around and investigating which products or services to buy.

In our system, you pay for the digital resources you use e.g. storage, network and compute capacity.

The person or company who wants to sell a service can broadcast their offering through opt-in marketing channels.

The FreeFlow Citizen chooses which channels are interesting to his/her current needs and receives money for actually looking at the offerings. E.g. I am looking to rent an apartment in a certain location or I am looking for a web designer or … I will allow publishers to send information to me.

Result

* Merchant will pay much less for marketing his products

* The consumer will receive money for shopping which could be more than the cost of running a 3bot.

Basically, this system puts the marketing world upside down and has benefits for consumers and merchants but not for the intermediaries which often don’t have a lot of added value yet still reap most of the benefits.

## The most scalable system in the world

[Most scalabel system](scalable.png)

## Safety & Security

Your information is stored in such a way that it can never be lost or stolen. You have privacy when you need it. You can ask for verification of your information like with a notary.

## Some advantages for the users of this system

* More Performance

    * Decentralized Video/Voice conferencing is faster.

    * Access to information is much faster because information is closer to you.

* More Convenience

    * Because all the apps are built using the same backend system which is basically you, the convenience will be much higher. 

    * No need for credit cards. 

    * Easier combination of services.

* Lower Cost of Services and Products

    * The more efficient system and elimination of certain unneeded middleman will lead to much lower cost of services or products.

    * We believe for certain services the difference can be substantial like up to 50%

* More transparency and information about the source of the service/product

    * Thanks to the 3bot technology it is possible to track the origin of the service you use.

* Build in fair & neutral reputation system improves quality

    * The built in reputation system makes sure that quality and price are aligned.

    * The 3bot verification mechanisms are fair and neutral

* Access to more (educational) information	

    * All information at your fingertips

* Less manipulation	

    * The information you get will come guaranteed from sources you trust. Manipulation should be impossible.

* Equal Rights

    * No matter where you live you will be able to communicate & access information.

* Anyone can deliver services or products online and participate in the FreeFlow Economy.

    * No need for complex e-commerce or payment systems.

More information about how it has been build in our [Decentralized Information System document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1uZT03h4QLBh2RYEnUjZQvi2Xoy8fjbUn1eZN_PM8g6g).

## Viral system

This system is very viral and this will help fast adoption globally. 

Our aim is to have millions of people enabled within a couple of years.

Because of the decentralized nature and no scalability limits this system can scale much faster compared to centralized systems we know today.

## It feels too much, can this really be done?

We believe this is very achievable and in fact we are already well on the way to executing on this mission. Today we already have more capacity online compared to the sum of all other blockchain projects.

We are pragmatic and our motto is to do more with less effort. Our technology allows us to be very efficient and our effort to create these services is maybe upto 100 times easier than if we would have to build these services from scratch.

We need more funding though, we are self funded today and have enough to continue but we feel we can go faster and enable more companies to become part of our FreeFlow Nation.

One of our keys to succeed are our partnerships and already today we have quite some partners aligned to make all of this reality.

# FreeFlow Nation Citizenship

[Flag](flag.png)

Everyone can become a citizen of our FreeFlow nation as long as they agree with our values.

We probably need a flag, digital identity card, maybe even a video or song uniting us (-:

One of our ThreeFold ambassadors created a [Declaration of independence](https://digindec.com/) (it's just an idea for now).

Such a declaration could be the starting point for someone to become a FreeFlow Citizen.

# FreeFlow Financial System

Every nation needs a financial system. A big part of our vision is to make sure we have a credible financial system which is compatible with the existing physical as well as our digital world.

## World's First Decentralized Bank (NBH Digital)

[girl with umbrella in front of yellow wall](yellowwallumbrella.png)

A decentralized banking wallet without limits, enabling you to control your financial wellbeing from the palm of your hands, with easy to use and easy to access global digital and fiat markets without physical tellers or intermediaries. 

In your digital banking app (secure wallet) you will have the following functions

* Your financial assets

    * Gold Tokens = 1 gr of physical gold, stored on name

    * ThreeFold Tokens = backed by the internet capacity empowering our digital nation.

    * EUR/USD Tokens

    * Other Cryptocurrencies

* Your own personal exchange (decentralized)

* Access to Forex Trading (decentralized)

* Access to Lending providers (decentralized)

* Automated payment and invoicing services (decentralized)

* Verification & Digital Notary services (decentralized)

* And much more to come.

Premium accounts will be charged a monthly fee and there will be no transaction fees for transferring money. Exchange rates between the digital currencies are also non existing.

Aim is to add more than 10.000 users per day within 1.5 years from now.

### Why will users prefer this service compared to their current banks?

* Cost per month will be lower.

* No transaction fees.

* Free transfer of money on a global basis.

* Ease of use, this will be the easiest banking app ever.

* Safety & reliability, this solution is more safe compared to any other solution thanks to the decentralized nature and the usage of the 3bot technology

* More transparency.

* Access to more reliable & liquid digital currencies like gold token & threefold token.

* Access to innovative banking products like digital notary and automated invoice & payment services.

## FreeFlow Currencies

[hands full of coffee beans](coffee.png)

Our FFC’s (FreeFlow Currencies)  represent the birth of new kinds of digital currencies;  ones that are designed to be responsible, value-backed and serve a real market and human requirement. They are not speculative instruments or interest driven by design, rather their value and growth are dependent on the social or market problem they aim to resolve and by design all FFC’ s are driven by the same narrative; value, fairness and inclusion. Eventually there will be hundreds of different types of currencies but the first currencies we start with are listed below:

### ThreeFold Token (Now)

A reliable & responsible digital currency. This is the token used to build the ThreeFold grid.

Corresponds with internet capacity = has a real value.

* Internet capacity = fuel for the digital economy and is growing super fast

* No tokens have ever been printed, it's not hyped; every token is result of farming & capacity generated in the field.

Undervalued at this point

* Today more capacity compared to all other blockchain companies combined

* Other blockchain company's market cap = multiple billions.

* Our market cap of liquid tokens < 20m USD. Other blockchain company's market cap = multiple billions.

### EuroFlow Token (Q3)

Wouldn’t it be nice you can do digital business with a token which has a 1-1 relationship with the EUR.

1 EUR Token has same value as 1 EUR and is guaranteed available. Regular audits guarantee the availability of all tokens.

### GoldFlow Token (Q2)

1 Gold Token corresponds with 1 gram of physically stored Gold (in Denmark). The vault has capacity for 1.000 ton of gold. Each token has the exact same value of 1 gram of gold and can be freely used to do business or as a store of value.

### FreeFlow Token (Q3)

Freeflow Token corresponds to 1 h of labour. Each user into the FreeFlow notion gets 100 h worth of free FreeFlow Tokens. This token can be used to exchange value. It's a token especially important for refugee camps or other places where money is not available yet still people want to exchange services.

### FairCoffee Token (2020)

A Coffee Token corresponds with 1 kg of coffee. FCT will enable transparent end to end journey from production to market to ensure source, transparency and fairness to local farmers.

### Veda Education Token and Organic Farming Token (Q4)

The Veda Education Token can be used to help children with access to education.

The Organic Farming Token is a token which is the only means of buying certain products from certain farming areas (in first version Costa Rica). 

This token has the same value as 1 TFT.

# Other FreeFlow Projects

[rocket liftoff](rocket.png)

## ThreeFold Capacity Bank

Is not one project, will be more than 100 projects where money gets invested in delivering internet capacity (the FreeFlow Nation highway if you want) to emerging markets. 

Each project can deliver this internet capacity at a cost price up to 5 times lower compared to the current market leaders like Amazon, Google Cloud, …

The ThreeFold Capacity Bank will also issue TFT Futures, which is a promise on a ThreeFold token.

The value of a global grid of internet capacity is invaluable.

This capacity can be used by members of the FreeFlow Nation but will be as relevant for any other IT user of the current IT ecosystem. 

## FreeFlow Incubator

An incubator which will fund 10-20 startups. 

Some of the projects will be there to create an alternative to existing centralized web deliver models like Uber, Deliveroo, Airbnb, … These startups will use the FreeFlow decentralized bank as well as the ThreeFold Grid. 

Already 5 technologies are developed to proof of concept mode.

## FreeFlow Fund

[butterfly](butterfly.png)

We are in the process to create a 0.5 Billion USD fund in Malta. We believe that decentralization, new digital currencies and new communication technologies are the underpinning of a new digital decentralized world and as such are a great opportunity to be invested in.

This fund will be well regulated to give comfort to it's investors. An experienced team of investment managers and administrators will run the fund.

**The fund will invest in 4 pillars**

* **make it possible = Technology (30%)**

    * ThreeFold Tech, has the ambition to get an exit of at least 1 Billion USD.

    * Kleos, efficient mobile wireless technology, 
up to 300.000 data connections per base station are possible.

    * NBH Digital, world first true decentralized bank, aiming for millions of users.

* **make it grow = Capacity/Assets (50%)**
Deployment of capacity for the new decentralized world = deploy, own and operate assets

    * mobile base stations, bringing efficient cost effective connectivity everywhere in the world

    * capacity for the ThreeFold Grid = ThreeFold Capacity Bank

    * new complementary currency projects, …

* **make the future = Incubation of startups (15%)**

    * Our Incubator [Incubaid](http://www.incubaid.com) want to support a new ecosystem of startups who like the idea of this decentralized world and want to build applications or other solutions on top.

* **support the future = impact investments (5%)**

    * Investment in impact projects like education, farming technology, ...

#  Some other Freelow/ThreeFold related projects

[leaf in hand](leaf.png)

## Veda Education project in Luxor (Egypt)

We believe Education is incredibly important and the basis for a world becoming more healthy.

We are working on a project where our tools can be used to deliver education content to everyone in the world with equal chances at the lowest cost possible. The project in Luxor is a first reference case.

## Cultivo (Costa Rica Farming Project) 

Cultivo is a trust that aims to protect precious rainforest lands, converts local farms to organic production, and enable digital farming economies in Costa Rica. Cultivo will have a token backed by organic farmland assets to protect the rainforest and to engage farmers in Costa Rica (timing to be defined).

## Decentralized Video Conferencing System

Enables anyone to work together from anywhere in the world; a web conference platform that is simple, secure and accessible. Ensures complete privacy through a secure network of decentralized nodes that route the most efficient and direct paths between sessions for optimum performance. 

## FreeFlow Pages = Alternative to Facebook

Is a social space where privacy and social media coexist. Thanks to our "circles" approach to user identity and empowerment, FreeFlow Pages will put the user first and incontrol of their social experience.

# Reality Check

Our team is not big enough at this point to execute on all as defined above. We need to be very focused to execute on what is required first.

We already got amazingly far but some items need more ‘love’:

* Web Presence is not in line with vision & capabilities & mission, people get confused.

    * A lot of information missing on our wiki’s and github (our code repositories)

* Marketing Message not good enough

    * Need to go over all text & information & make consistent

* ...
