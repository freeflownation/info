# Why?

## A Value Shift is happening.

![Value Shift](shift.png)

* From Fear To Love				=  			 respect for self, others & nature

* From Centralization To Decentralisation  	= 			 in control over own destiny

* From Marketing To Transparency	 	=  			 what you see is what you get

More and more people want this value shift to happen and they want to set an example.

### Fear To Love

In our post Darwin times, we have been raised in a fear-driven way. The "survival of the fittest" theme is everywhere: law (contracts), patents, dominate  your markets, be smarter, stronger, … 

There are other equally strong forces which we did not nurture. Our world has become too efficient a place where the law of the strongest rules. If we want to help heal the planet we need to change our mentality towards others and ourselves. We believe the world is shifting, catering for those who want to live their lives based upon love, compassion and respect.

### Decentralization

People are not powerless, they need to take ownership over their own decisions. But to be able to do this they need access to neutral and reliable information. To be able to do this decentralization is a must. Many of us want this to happen.

### Transparency

Too much information is a non fair representation of the reality. As human beings, we need to take responsibility and make sure that we become transparent in our own daily life. More and more people are waking up and  wanting to set an example. Being able to be brutally honest takes a lot of courage and self love.

## Participatory Economy

Liberalism has brought the world to where we are today. (Un)fortunately the world is now coming to the end of that era, our planet cannot cope with the consequences of the incredible growth we’ve experienced over the last 100 years. 

New systems are required. Some original thinkers have developed a system they describe as a participatory economy. In our FreeFlow Nation, we can potentially adopt some of these concepts and try to build a system which could support these ideas. As far as we know no practical system  has been developed which makes implementing the values of this participatory economic system possible.

Values, as defined in a participatory economy, are:

* Self-Management 	–   decision making in proportion to the degree one is affected

* Justice 		–   reward for effort or personal sacrifice

* Solidarity	 	–   concern for the well-being of others

* Diversity 		–   the flourishing of a variety of lifestyles and outcomes

* Efficiency 		–   meeting our goals without wasting our limited time and resources

* Sustainability 		–   protecting and nurturing our natural environment

The information management system we need for our FreeFlow nation needs to be different:

It should not be like a typical blockchain project (shared information) and it certainly shouldn't be centralized

We believe looking at nature is the biggest source of inspiration. Nature took millions of years to create organisms which are beautiful, resilient and still efficient.
