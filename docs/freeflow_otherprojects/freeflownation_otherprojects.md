## ThreeFold Capacity Bank

Is not one project, will be more than 100 projects where money gets invested in delivering internet capacity (the FreeFlow Nation highway if you want) to emerging markets. 

Each project can deliver this internet capacity at a cost price up to 5 times lower compared to the current market leaders like Amazon, Google Cloud, …
