We (the citizens of FreeFlow Nation) believe the world needs a new nation, a global complementary digital nation. A Nation to complement not replace our existing nations, a Nation which has no physical boundaries and which welcomes everyone as a digital citizen.

**A digital Nation where everyone chooses to honor the following values :
**

1. Everyone can participate and has equal chances

2. Respect is the basis of our communication and actions

3. Everyone has control over their own information & community circles

4. Information is neutral, verifiable and accessible for everyone

5. We should never be a product

6. We need to respect the worldâ€™s resources and we need to pay for what we consume

7. Everyone has access to reliable (complementary) currencies

8. Products need to be sustainable and fairly described

9. We accept that we are not powerless and have a responsibility to act 

We have been working for more than 15 years on a technology that can facilitate this platform and vision.

It's not just a set of ideas, we have already developed most of the required technology and are executing a practical achievable plan.
